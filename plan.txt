Create components for:
    - General info
    - Educational experience
    - Practical experience

To have the edit and submit button in the parent file would require me to overwrite the css for each component.

Perhaps by using !important? No

By using display: none for the input boxes, and submitting the info to divs that will take the place of the input boxes and will have a display: grid setting? Possibly, but I think there is a way to do so with props and state.

    - Use jsx to layout each info area
    - Set up an infoMain prop that is equal to an input element
    - Pass this prop to each of the jsx elements as each element's child
    - Create a submit and edit button 
    - Submission of the form will set the new state of each info area to be the value of each elements corresponding input (or the text)
    - Clicking the edit button will do the inverse and set the state back to the input boxes

function inputCreation () {
    return (
        <>
            const infoInput = document.createElement("input")
            infoInput.setAttribute("classList", "infoInput")
        </>
    )
}

function info () {
    return (
        <>
            <div classList ="info-blocks">
                <div classList="info-block name">
                    infoMain
                </div>
            </div>
            <button>edit</button>
            <button>submit</button>
        </>
    )
}
